WikiSearchEngine
================
Final Project for Data Structures.

Reads from folder in directory called "WikiDump" and XML docs called "../WikiDumpPart###.xml" where ### represents three numerals that correspond to the file number.

Constructs an index for finding a word or set of words from the files.

Allows access to top search results for a given boolean query.

Has ability to write persistent inverted index and metadata and load from the same file rather than taking the time to read a large number of files every time
